# CredenceAI

> **Building trust in an AI-powered world.**  
> Claim → Evidence → Verdict.  
> From misinformation checks to enterprise credibility standards.

## What We Do
CredenceAI is developing a credibility engine that:
- **Verifies claims** in news, research, and media.
- **Retrieves transparent evidence** from trusted sources.
- **Classifies stance** (support / refute / unclear).
- **Delivers verdicts** with clear reasoning.

Our long-term vision is to become the **credibility layer for the internet** —  
a standard as recognizable as SSL certificates or verified checkmarks.

## Repositories
